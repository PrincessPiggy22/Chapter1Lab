# Reflection Questions

### 1. What was the most challenging part of translating from Python concepts to Java syntax?
  The Syntax. It is very different but the logic is the same so it's not too bad.
### 2. When did you use AI assistance and what did it help you with?
   I kinda didn't. I checked the GitHub Gist stuff for syntax.
   If I ever did use AI, it would just be to explain what an error meant.
### 4. Was there anything in Java that you liked better than in Python?
  Not neccesarily. Java is incredibly wordy and I feel like it's better if 
  coding languages were short and simple. "Keep it simple stupid" y'know?
  I don't hate it and I don't like it. It's all nuetral.
